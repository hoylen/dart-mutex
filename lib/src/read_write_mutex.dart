/// **Protecting critical code**
///
/// The [protectWrite] and [protectRead] are convenience methods for acquiring
/// locks and releasing them. Using them will ensure the locks are always
/// released after use.
///
/// Create the mutex:
///
///     m = ReadWriteMutex();
///
/// Code protected by a write lock:
///
///     await m.protectWrite(() {
///        // critical write section
///     });
///
/// Other code can be protected by a read lock:
///
///     await m.protectRead(() {
///         // critical read section
///     });
///
///
/// **Explicitly managing locks**
///
/// Alternatively, the locks can be explicitly acquired and managed. In this
/// situation, the program is responsible for releasing the locks after they
/// have been used. Failure to release the lock will prevent other code for
/// ever acquiring a lock.
///
/// Create the mutex:
///
///     m = ReadWriteMutex();
///
/// Some code can acquire a write lock:
///
///     await m.acquireWrite();
///     try {
///       // critical write section
///       assert(m.isWriteLocked);
///     } finally {
///       m.release();
///     }
///
/// Other code can acquire a read lock.
///
///     await m.acquireRead();
///     try {
///       // critical read section
///       assert(m.isReadLocked);
///     } finally {
///       m.release();
///     }
///
/// The current implementation lets locks be acquired in first-in-first-out
/// order. This ensures there will not be any lock starvation, which can
/// happen if some locks are prioritised over others. Submit a feature
/// request issue, if there is a need for another scheduling algorithm.
